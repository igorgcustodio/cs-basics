# Computer Science - Book of Knowledge

This repository is intended to learn and explain some CS basic concepts that I might have forgot or I didn't learn yet.

I'll implement some codes in C because we don't have this as language native features. These implementations are based on this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science).
